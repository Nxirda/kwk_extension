QUICK REMARKS
================================================================================

1) For reductions we might need the same syntax in kwk than in eve with 
    std::pair<Op,Neutral Elem>
    With this we might need like : kwk::add, kwk::sub, kwk::mul, ...

2) We will need something to generate a wide of positions for functions such
   as map_index, generate, ...

3) Perf problems with iota, fill, copy, they are not that good vectorized for
   some reason ?
